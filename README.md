# ncbi_db
Tools to build your own copy of selected entries form the ncbi databases

Work in progress. Right now these tools are available: 

- ncbi_db_info.py      simply to display the available fields in any ncbi DB, browsable through the BioPython tools
- ncbi_assembly.py     to browse the available assemblies/genomes for any species or lineage, including their annotation/proteome, and possibly download them in a local folder
